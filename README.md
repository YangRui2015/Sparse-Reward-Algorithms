# Sparse-Reward-Algorithms

We implemented many classes of Sparse Reward algorithms in Gym Fetch environment including Reward Shaping, Imitation Learning, Curriculum Learning, Hindsight Experience Replay, Curiosity-Driven Exploration, Hierachical Reinforcement Learning. This work is for better understanding of sparse reward algorithms.

Our code is based on https://github.com/andrew-j-levy/Hierarchical-Actor-Critc-HAC- and we have changed a lot on code simplif ication and content richness.
